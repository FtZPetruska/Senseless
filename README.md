# Senseless

Repository for the weekend-long homebrew game jam.

## Concept

The game consists of a 2D platformer in which the character lost all their senses.

Your only way to perceive your surroundings is to use a sonar giving you a snapshot of your environment.

## Enemies

You're not the only walking down this corridor, foes are lurking in the dark, tracking you down relentlessly.

Here are the enemies you can expect to encounter:

- The Stalker will follow your every move, he may be slow, but don't let him catch up to you.
- Luis is hungover, don't make a sound or he'll rush down to silence you.
- The Magnetick will throw itself at you, if you let it bite you, you'll feel sluggish for a bit.
- The Vagrant will wander aimlessly, bouncing off any wall it encounters. Don't cross his path or you'll regret it.
- The Doorman will block your path until you fulfil his demand.
