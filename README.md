# Yet Another C++ Project Template

[![Build and Tests](https://github.com/FtZPetruska/Yet-Another-cpp-Project-Template/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FtZPetruska/Yet-Another-cpp-Project-Template/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Inspired by https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/gui_starter_template, this project provides a subset of the available options with a different approach to CMake usage.

This is just my little project so I can quickly get started on writing software. Feel free to open issues to provide suggestions, or PR to submit improvements!
